# Professional Summary
Professional software developer with 4+ years of experience and extensive knowledge of the software development life-cycle.

In my last position, as a senior engineer in backend team, I did everything I could to improve the productivity of my team.

For example, I popularized testing, taught many things need to know to our members, and built a CI/CD pipeline so that we could release high-quality applications quickly.
